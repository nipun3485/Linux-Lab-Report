# Experiment 11 – Shell Programming (User Interaction and Database)

## Objective
To learn how shell scripts take input from users, split sentences into words, modify the Internal Field Separator (IFS), and perform text validation like palindrome checking.

---

## Task 1 – Split a Sentence into Words

### Script: split_words.sh
This script:
- Takes a full sentence as input
- Automatically splits words using default IFS
- Prints each word on a new line

### Command to Run
./split_words.sh

---

## Task 2 – Split Words Using Custom IFS (Space Only)

### Script: split_words_custom.sh
This script:
- Saves original IFS
- Sets IFS to a single space
- Splits and prints words accordingly
- Restores original IFS

### Command to Run
./split_words_custom.sh

---

## Task 3 – Palindrome Check

### Script: palindrome.sh
This script:
- Reads a string input
- Reverses it using `rev`
- Compares original and reversed strings
- Outputs whether it is a palindrome

### Command to Run
./palindrome.sh

---

## Output
Add your screenshots in this folder with names like:
- output11_1.png
- output11_2.png
- output11_3.png

---

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrated user interaction, word processing, IFS manipulation, and string validation in shell scripting. Each script highlights fundamental text-processing concepts used in Linux automation.
